Before starting to retrieve data from Twitter, you need do some set up in a few steps.

1. Go to Twitter Developer Portal (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal/overview) and sign in to your Twitter account. 
If you don't have a twitter account, please sign up a Twitter account first. Try to use gmail or outlook account if possible.


2. Creat a project and connect it to an app, suppose you just have your developer account.
First create a new project with project description and select an approapriate use-case. 
Then, you need to create an app under "Elevated" (an App is a container for your API Keys that you need in order to make an HTTP request to the Twitter API).
Once you created your app and connect your project to it, you will get API keys and the Bearer Token that you will use to connect to the new endpoints in the Twitter API v2.
Copy your API key, API secret key and Bearer Token in the safe place in your local machine. You will use them later when you start making API call to retrieve data from Twitter.
